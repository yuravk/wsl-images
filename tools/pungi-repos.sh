# Rewrite the working tree to build the WSL images from the PUNGI
# pre-release repositories (https://<arch>-pungi-<major>.almalinux.dev)
# instead of the public repositories. This allows building WSL images
# before an AlmaLinux version is publicly released. Counterpart of
# tools/pungi-repos.sh in the cloud-images repository.
#
# The rootfs build scripts (rootfs/almalinux_<major>_<arch>.sh) bootstrap
# the image with a single 'dnf --installroot' run inside the released
# quay.io/almalinuxorg/almalinux:<major> builder container, resolving
# against the container's standard repositories - there are no repository
# URLs in the scripts to substitute. Instead, the script injects exclusive
# PUNGI compose repositories into that dnf command, right after its
# --releasever option:
#
#     --disablerepo='*'
#     --repofrompath=pungi-baseos,<compose>/BaseOS/<arch>/os/
#     --repofrompath=pungi-appstream,<compose>/AppStream/<arch>/os/
#     --enablerepo='pungi-*'
#     --nogpgcheck
#
# where <compose> is
#
#   https://<archdash>-pungi-<major>.almalinux.dev/almalinux/<major>/<arch>/latest_result_almalinux/compose
#
# with <archdash> being the arch with underscores dashed for the host name
# (x86_64 -> x86-64, x86_64_v2 -> x86-64-v2; aarch64 as-is). The script
# file name suffixes map to the repository arches as x64 -> x86_64,
# x64_v2 -> x86_64_v2, ARM64 -> aarch64. gpgcheck is off as pre-release
# compose packages may not be signed yet.
#
# Only the builder's dnf command line is touched - nothing is written into
# /rootfs, so the shipped image keeps the standard repositories seeded by
# the almalinux-release package (which itself comes from the compose).
#
# The scripts derive their default minor version from the almalinux-release
# package of the repository they build from (tools/almalinux-release.sh);
# the rewrite exports PUNGI_REPOS=1 for that call, so an image built from
# the compose is named after the pre-release version it contains (e.g.
# 10.3 while the public repositories still ship 10.2).
#
# With gpgcheck off, dnf never runs the GPG key import a GA build performs
# while installing signed packages, so the image would ship without the
# gpg-pubkey entry in its rpmdb (prompting on the first dnf install on a
# running instance). An explicit 'rpm --root=/rootfs --import' of the
# major's key is injected right after the dnf install, keeping the PUNGI
# image content identical to a GA build.
#
# Intentionally NOT rewritten:
#   - AlmaLinux 8: no PUNGI hosts exist - 8 keeps building from the
#     public repositories.
#   - AlmaLinux Kitten: a rolling, stream-based OS with no releases -
#     its public repos already ARE the latest compose, so there is no
#     pre-release state to switch to. Kitten keeps its public repos.
#
# The script is idempotent: scripts already carrying the pungi-baseos
# repository are skipped, so a second run is a no-op. No arguments.
